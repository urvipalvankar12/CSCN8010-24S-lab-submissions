This folder contains students submissions.Each student should:1. Create a sub-folder, named with their student ID.2. Create a README.md file in their sub-folder, with their name in the first line. Adding further text is optional.3. To submit a practical lab assignment - add one file named labX.ipynb for every practical lab assignment the student's subfolder (X is the lab number, e.g. 2, 3).An example of how a students submission folder should be named and look like is provided in the sub-folder 123456789.It is important to follow these guidelines, otherwise you might be required to re-do the submissions for them to get graded.
