## Practical Lab 2 - Data Visualizations and Publication using Github Pages

The purpose of this lab is to learn how to use notebooks in VSCode, to create simple visualizations and text around them, and how to convert them to a common HTML format and publish them online. In the rest of the course we will learn about ML algorithms that will allow us to add interesting content into these notebooks and HTMLs. This lab presents an end-to-end workflow (or skeleton) for writing and publishing analysis.

###  Create a Notebook with Markdown and Graphs

(4 points out of 6)

1. Create at least 4 graphs using either `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` or `Plotly` (or a combination of these). You can use the examples provided in the Galleries that these packages provides (links appear in our presentation about visualizations)
2. Add Markdown text, with a headline, that provides a very brief overview of the graphs (e.g. one sentence for each). Feel free to add additional Markdown elements (links, tables, images) if you like (this is not necessary for having a perfect grade, but will demonstrate a wider visualization toolset, that you could use for presenting your future analyses).

### Publish the notebook to Github repository

(2 points out of 6)

1. Push the above created notebook to your lab-submission fork
2. Create a Pull Request with lab submission title such as "Lab1" to propose your changes to the upstream repository
